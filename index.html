# Main questions for economics

- What products are being produced and in what quantities? (For example: what
types of malarial prevention measures are being provided and how much of
each type?)

- By what methods are these products produced? (What resources are required to
produce these malarial prevention measures?)

- How is society’s output of goods and services divided among its members? (Who
has access to these measures?)

- How efficient is society’s production and distribution? (Can we get the same amount of protection from malaria using fewer resources? Would an AIDS awareness campaign be a more effective use of resources than malarial prevention?)

# Efficiency 

- ## Efficiency=making most of what we’ve got!

  - Technical Efficiency = producing maximum benefit (outputs) from given inputs (resources), or given level of benefit from least inputs
  
  - Economic Efficiency = producing maximum benefit from given budget, or given level of benefit at least possible cost (value of resources)
  
  - Allocative Efficiency = producing the mix of benefits (from a given set of resources) that is most highly valued
  
---
# Example of efficiency 

- Primary care clinic combines inputs to provide ‘health’ for a population:

  - consultation rooms, treatment rooms, office space, doctor time, nurse time, etc.
  
  - Different possible combinations of inputs:
  
    - a larger waiting area and fewer treatment rooms, or more nurses and fewer doctors, etc.
    
  - Technically efficient:
  
    - not possible to provide ‘health’ to any more patients without using more of at least one input (nurse time, doctor time, etc.)

---
# Economist is NOT about ...

- ### Concerned with (saving) money

  - Store of value
  
  - Means of exchange

- ### The same as accountancy

  - Monitoring financial transactions
  
- ### Only practiced by economists

  - Everyone has choices
  
  - Economists just think of these explicitly
  
---
# Economics is

- ### Concerned with

  - Costs (resource use)

  - Benefits

  - Choice
  
  - Efficiency
  
- ### Basically, if I choose X do the benefits outweigh the costs?

  - If yes then doing X is efficient
  
  - If no then doing X is inefficient
  
---

# Application of economics

  - Positive economics
  
  - Normative economics

---

# Health and economics 

- Economics focuses on ‘utility’: the level of
‘happiness’ resulting from consumption

- Health is thus one component of utility. This
has important implications:

  - Health is not the sole objective of behaviours
  
  -  Creates trade-offs and choices between health and
other objectives – e.g. education, defence etc

- Health economics is the discipline of economics
applied to the topic of health

  - In practice, health economics is predominantly (but
not solely) “health care” economics: goods and
services produced (by health sector) primarily to
affect health status

---

# Health Economics map 

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;img src="libs/pic/HE-pilot.png" width = "800"&gt;

&lt;center&gt;

---
# Value of health 

- Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)

  - Combine length and quality of life
  
---

# Other influences on health 

  - ## Economics of obesity - technology is fattening
  
    - Study examined the relationship between ‘price’ of
food and food consumption/weight

    - Technological change has altered the relative prices of
consuming calories and expending calories 

      - Reduced the price of food (calories)
      
      - Reduced time costs of food (calories) preparation
      
      - Changed the nature of work
---

# Demand for health care, supply of health care, and market analysis 


---
# Creating incentives 

- “The typical economist believes the world has not yet invented a problem that cannot be fixed if given a free hand to design the proper incentive scheme” (Levitt and Dubner, “Freakonomics”)

- An incentive is simply a means by which someone is persuaded to (not) do something

  - Eg. F-F-S is to treat more patients; increase price of tobacco or soft-drinks is to reduce consumption; etc

- Incentive is seen to be a means of urging people to do more of a ‘good’ thing and less of a ‘bad’ thing (a ‘perverse’ incentive is the reverse)

# Macro-economic appraisal 

## WHO ranking of health systems

# Micro-economics appraisal

# Is health economics ethical? 

Health economics may appear to be unethical
because it implies some individuals being denied
health care. But:
• The need to ration is not simply the result of having a
small budget. It is more fundamental than this
• Health care is only one way of improving health –
better sanitation, housing, education, environment, etc
• Economics tends to focus on society rather than
individuals, requiring divergent ethical constructs
! Unethical not to consider economic aspects:
• Rationing would occur by another (opaque) means
• Will never have enough resources to exhaust all the
possibilities to produce some (small) health benefit
• There are other things of value than ‘health’ - balance

---
# Final word...

- Health economics is the application of economics to the study of health and health care

- It is important because:

  - Our health is important to us
  
  - Health is affected by our choices
  
  - The health sector is very significant to the economy
  
  - Decisions in health (care) often determined by economic environment

- (Health) economics is not concerned with saving money, but with improving people’s lives

- Health economics is quite literally a matter of life and death!
